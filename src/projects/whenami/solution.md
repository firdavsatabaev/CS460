Step1: extracted secret.zip file and stored the extracted files in a new folder called secret
Step2: After the extraction, I found a comment by running (7z x secret.zip) and cleaned it up from commas and periods in (app.py)
Step3: Splitted the data and stored it in a list
Step4: Ran for loop in order test every index value as a password (which ended up being bunch of words)
Step5: Extracted all the images by using (for i in (cat comment.txt ) 7z x secret.1.2.3.4.5.6 -p$i) 
Step6: Final picture shows the Covid mask which a woman is wearing but date is not shown so i think the image was created by Igor Pavlov in 2016-05-21
