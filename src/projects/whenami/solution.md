Step1: extracted secret.zip file and stored the extracted files in a new folder called secret
Step2: After the extraction, I found a comment by running (7z x secret.zip) and cleaned it up from commas and periods in (app.py)
Step3: Splitted the data and stored it in a list
Step4: Ran for loop in order test every index value as a password (which ended up being bunch of words)

Step6: The image was created by Igor Pavlov in 2016-05-21
