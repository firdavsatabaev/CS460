Total passwords cracked: 17
Tools used:


To crack some passwords from data/projects/passwords/sam.txt/ I used an online password cracker https://crackstation.net/  The website required to use non-salted hash values, therefore, I only used hash values from the given file and was able to crack 9 passwords. 



Ran Hashcat (1000, 4830, 1800) for several days using wordlist Rockyou.txt was able to extract few passwords from all three files. 


I ran my computer for 4 days straight on shadow file using wordlist rockyou.txt (from github, it appears first on Google if searched). Due to the size of the wordlist and the length of the salted hashes, it overheated, the fan worked very hard and I had to abort running the programm to avoid from computer melt. If i had better computer or came up with better way instead of just running programm on the files, I would probably crack them all.
